This is a Machine Learning program that implements an algorithm on the given image.
I created it to practice my mathematics. Below is the step-by-step process I followed in this project:  

1) Seeing the Data, and insight about all inputs and outputs
2) The 4 inputs were sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width and 3 outputs were setosa, versicolor and virginica
3) Mathematical Formulation – Defined the necessary mathematical concepts, with classifications and activation formulas.  
4) Python Project Implementation:  
   - I created a variable that name was Y_one_hot that inserted for setosa[1,0,0],versicolor[0,1,0] and virginica[0,0,1] for multiple output 
   - Layers: Defined input (X) and output (Y) layers(that in this case were 3).  
   - Parameter Initialization: Initialized weights (W) and bias (b). 
   - Forward Propagation: Computed the output using the formula  Y = W @ X + b
   - Activation(Sigmoid): Calculated the activation for the Machine Learnign algorithm that was 1/(1 + exp(-Z)) , Z is the output from the forward propagation
   - Cost Computation: Calculated the cost function L(w,b) = (-Y_one_hot * log(A) - (1 - Y_one_hot) * log(1 - A)).  
   - Backpropagation: Derived partial derivatives to compute gradients dW  and db.  
   - Gradient Descent: Applied the Gradient Descent algorithm to optimize parameters.  
   - Neural Network Model: Combined all components into a functional model.  
5) Prediction Generation – Used the trained model to make predictions.  
6) Evaluate Model - its used for evualated model % prediction
7) Result Comparison – Evaluated the predictions against actual values.  


-IrisDiagram.py is for showing the Diagrams of the Data

This repository is dedicated to practicing and experimenting with Machine Learning concepts and techniques.
I work mainly with TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch, exploring how different models, layers, and optimization methods work in practice.
The goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of Machine Learning by implementing various exercises, testing ideas, and improving my skills through hands-on experimentation.
